### Hi, I'm Héctor 👋🏼

I'm a Software Engineer specialized in Machine Learning. I particularly enjoy
working with different technologies related to web development and Machine
Learning, mostly Python and NodeJS libraries.

- 🔭 I’m currently working for a broker company building their back-end to
  manage their ETL pipeline and quickly identify issues within it. The system
  enables them to collect and analyse data to identify the best time to perform
  their transactions.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning about Web Development and Machine Learning.
- 👯 I’m very interested in collaborating on Open Source projects that can help
  vulnerable people to have a better life.
- 💬 Ask me about European football!
- 📫 Find me on Twitter as [@IpiVasquez][twitter] or on [LinkedIn][linkedin]!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/his.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a weird kind of geek.
